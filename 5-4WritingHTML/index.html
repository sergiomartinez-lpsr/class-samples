		<h1>1. Sergio Martinez</h1>
		<p>For Martinez, everything started when he was playing for Escuela de Futbol Tarimoro. Playing as a centermid, Sergio won the Guanajuato State Cup and was a runner up for Nationals. He played for a while at the FC Celaya Academy where he won one title. At 14 years old, he transfered to Richmond Sol Cobras on a $200 dollar transfer. In his first season with Cobras U15, he won U15 NorCal Premier League 2015. He finished the season with 4 goals and 6 assists in 10 games. Unfortunately, injuries have had a big role on Sergio's career. In July of 2015, a torned quadriceps stopped him for 3 weeks from playing. Also in December of 2015, an inflamed appendix caused him to play only one game in the Ajax U15 College Showcase. Despite all his injuries, Sergio is without a doubt up there with the greatest of all time.</p>
